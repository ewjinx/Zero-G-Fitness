We created a fitness game called "Zero-G Fitness" which allows astronauts currently living in microgravity environments for prolonged missions to stimulate their physical and mental health by playing games in the form of exercises which simulate their actual onboard training regimen. To address the challenge's objective i.e. developing a game that leverages the unique microgravity environment of space and promotes their physical and psychological health, "Zero-G Fitness" contains minigames which can be played by astronauts to perform actions simulating their training regimen. The interface uses "body-tracking/motion-capture" along with "avatar projection" in the game, allowing users to interact with the game's projections and components, all mimicking the exercise actions or "reps" needed for astronauts to cover in their regiment. Established research proves that all astronauts, in their prolonged missions involving space travel, suffer from various afflictions, such as decreased bone density, muscle atrophy and impairment of vision on the physical side. It also results in and/or develops mental illnesses such as depression, anxiety and stress-related disorders. "Zero-G Fitness" combats this by not only allowing astronauts to follow their step-by-step daily routine required training regimen of cardio, strength and resistive training, but also gamifies the process to enhance engagement, entertainment and contributes to the overall well-being and cohesion of astronauts' crews, while enhancing their resilience and adaptability in the extraterrestrial frontier.
